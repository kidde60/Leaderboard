## Getting Started

**Clone Your Github Repository**
Follow these steps to clone your Github repo on Windows:

1. Open Git Bash;

- If Git is not already installed, it is super simple. Just go to the Git Download Folder and follow the instructions.

2. Go to the current directory where you want the cloned directory to be added;

- To do this, input cd and add your folder location. You can add the folder location by dragging the folder to Git bash.
- $ cd '/c/Users/Documents/My First Git Project'

3. Go to the page of the repository that you want to clone.
4. Click on ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù and copy the URL.
5. Use the git clone command along with the copied URL from earlier;

- $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY

6. Press Enter;

- $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY

**Congratulations, you have created your first local clone from your remote Github repository.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Install operating system that best work for you.
- Install the latest version of node.
- Install your favorite Text Editor

### Setup

1. Set-up linters in your local env
2. Copy and paste the linter files to your local directory.
3. The npm package manager is going to create a node_modules directory to install all of your dependencies.You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a .gitignore file and add node_modules/ to it:
4. you need to initialize npm to create package.json file
5. run npm install --save-dev hint@6.x

- add hintrc
- run npx hint .

6. .stylelintrc
7. run npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
8. run  npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
9. eslint:
   Run
   npm install --save-dev eslint@7.x eslint-config-airbnb-base@14.x eslint-plugin-import@2.x babel-eslint@10.x
10. Run npx eslint .
11. Fix linter errors.

- IMPORTANT NOTE: feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
